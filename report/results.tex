\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
The result of this research study is a tool for statistical research. A fully functional
weather station has been produced with the following functionalities:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Measuring various environmental parameters listed in section \ref{sec:introduction}
  \item Time of data acquisition from all sensors: $408\pm 100 ms$
  \item Time of transfer for a packet from ESP8266 to the Node server: $700\pm100ms$
  \item Total time to transfer from arduino to the end user: $2734\pm1000ms$
\end{itemize}

In short, the data that the user sees on the screen is around 3 seconds old. This delay is visible to the user because each packet includes a timestamp
of the time it was acquired.
It is worth to mention that the delay value is highly dependent on the user's internet connection speed and number of connected clients.
