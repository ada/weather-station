  This paper present the development of an embedded wireless weather station
  using off-the-shelf environmental sensors which measure various
  physical changes in the surrounding and visualizing the acquired data on a
  web browser client connected to a central server application written in JavaScript. The constructed weather station is capable of measuring temperature via
  multiple sensors, humidity, existence of clouds using ultraviolet sensor, rain by using capacitive resistance change,
  the intensity of illumination via light sensitive element and finally the ability to detect an
  approaching thunderstorm by measuring atmospheric charge. The weather station also disposes the dependency of
  a remote clock server to calculate solar and lunar times and positions due to the integration of a global positioning system
  which provides the weather station with accurate location and time. Visualization software
  is done in the charts and labels for each measured value.
