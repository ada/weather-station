This paper present the developemtn of an embedded wireless weather station module
using off-the-shelf and constructed enviromental sensors which measure various
physical changes in the surronding and visualizing the acquired data through a
fast and consist way via server applications in programming language JavaScript with
communications via TCP and UART. This weather station is capable of measure temperature via
multiple sensors, humidity, existense of clouds using ultra-violett sensor, rain by using capacitive resistance change,
the intensity of illumination via light sensitive element and finally is able to detect an
approaching thunderstorm by measuring atmospheric charge. The weather station also disposes the dependency of
a remote clock server to calculate solar and lunar times and positions due to the integration of a global positions system
which provides the weather station an accurate location and time. Visualization software
is done in the charts and labels for each measured and calculated quantity.
