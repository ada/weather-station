\section{Background and related work}
\label{sec:background}
Yash Mittal and et. al. presented the development of an ‘Online Smart Weather
Station System’ for studying the correlation amongst multiple weather parameters
data collected over a period of 18 months. The study focuses on finding the
correlations between Temperature, Relative Humidity and Wind Speed, which are
the most important weather parameters for agriculture and other field activities.
Correlation among temperature, humidity and wind-speed is presented using the mean
and standard deviation. Few important observations are made such as relative humidity
reduces when the air temperature increases, and vice versa. Also, the wind
speed seems to increase as the air temperature increases and humidity reduces.
These inferences are drawn by studying the mean and standard deviation in
day-wise plots for the three weather parameters studied. Possible
applications of this study are in agriculture, construction and manufacturing \cite{7443621}.
